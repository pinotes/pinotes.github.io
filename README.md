## README.md

Welcome to the site of Proletarian Internationalist Notes (PINotes)&mdash;news, reviews and analysis from a Maoist global perspective. This site's article content can be browsed entirely on github.com. This is it.

Non-technical visitors unfamiliar with GitHub can ignore the extraneous elements&mdash;buttons, tabs&mdash;on these pages. You should, however, browse in a "private" window, block scripts, and consider using an anonymizing network or proxy from a connection, device and location not associated with your identity, and not susceptible to easy monitoring as with many shared devices. You don't need to unblock any script here; enabling scripts isn't necessary to browse this site. Please read [pages/security.md](pages/security.md) entirely before continuing. It contains information that is important to know before visiting sites similar to this one.

After you have read security.md, go to [index.md](index.md) to browse articles. [Click here](pages/latest.md) to jump to pages/latest.md.

This address, https://github.com/pinotes/pinotes.github.io, is the most secure way to access the content on this site. The address is long, but try to memorize it. What people typically do to bookmark pages would not be appropriate in many cases. If you can't remember the long address yet and can't store it securely, an alternate address is [https://pinotes.github.io](https://pinotes.github.io). Make sure you are on https://, not http://, from the very start. If you aren't, you might be redirected to another site.

### Why GitHub?

After some consideration, it was decided that making content available through a single set of Markdown files on GitHub would give a secure way for most English-speakers to access the content without too much fuss, or much complexity on the publication side. It was the best of various options available for a site that is basically just a text repository not requiring interaction or scripting. Reading articles through the repository view on github.com limits the layout and style you can see and could make this site less attractive visually, but most readers may appreciate being able to view the content this way in the long run. If nothing else, the site is simple, with an emphasis on substance that respects the reader's intelligence. It's not that GitHub itself is particularly secure in every respect, or that everyone around it is trustworthy, but viewing articles through HTTPS and an address shared by millions of projects avoids some problems related to privacy or censorship where github.com as a whole isn't filtered. An issue involving the domain name system makes browsing through https://github.com/... (https://github.com/pinotes/pinotes.github.io) significantly more private than using the alternate GitHub address, https://pinotes.github.io, even when using a connection method like Tor. A variety of techniques and precautions should be used in combination. (The "pinotes.github.io" hostname is more specific and potentially less secure for browsing than "github.com" despite the longer addresses on github.com, basically because at some point a computer between you and the site must be told what the "pinotes" part refers to. Obviously, if one is using a computer where HTTPS is routinely broken for screening purposes, or is in some other situation like that, there are additional things to worry about. Using HTTPS with github.com doesn't eliminate the need for various other precautions.)

New writing appearing on this site first is in the public domain. The "Unlicense" applies to the extent the content of various files is a kind of software or code. The presence of this content on GitHub doesn't mean GitHub endorses or knows about any of it, but it is to GitHub's credit that this site is still here. Readers will see the extent to which GitHub tolerates speech.

In some countries (often exploited countries struggling against imperialism or carrying out repression on its behalf despite Western rhetoric and ideology about "democracy"), even mainstream media sites are blocked, or reading them activates a suspicious imagination. There are additional reasons to be careful about visiting, linking to or discussing sites claiming to be alternative, radical, or revolutionary, or careful about how ones goes about these things after deciding if they are necessary. Passersby who chance upon this site shouldn't be overly concerned, but more-frequent visitors need to have thought about their security needs thoroughly, including those who think of themselves as being just passive consumers of accurate information. No offense to anyone, but PINotes isn't here for ad revenue, donations, or career advancement, and doesn't have the need for exposure others might have so nothing is held back here in regard to visitors' security. Others do understand the need for security, but talk about tinfoil hats and such while expecting security privately or selectively for themselves&mdash;a typical bourgeois approach. Even if readers were all in imperialist countries countries (PINotes' intended main audience) and most likely exploiters and oppressors in terms of societal relationships, such an attitude toward security is fraught with danger for emerging movements, non-communist activists, and just potential future capitulators or collaborators with the international proletariat. It and related ideas about security&mdash;so pernicious in today's surveillance and security environment with many existing bad habits&mdash;often represent a particular viewpoint of privilege and power.

GitHub is a collaborative/social platform, but visitors with their own GitHub accounts are strongly discouraged from "watching" this repository or "following" this account, particularly if their account is connected to their identity in some way. GitHub just happens to have these features; PINotes is on GitHub for other reasons. GitHub pull requests may be welcomed in the distant future, but the current situation of content, readership, and movement development, doesn't justify inviting pull requests at this time and needing to handle the security issues that might arise and possible additional work load. The open source concept is still relevant in the sense that, if the original repository here goes down or moves dramatically or gradually in a wrong direction, anyone with/without moral justification could easily clone the repository or start from an old copy. It is important to pay attention to substance and to additions, deletions, and their possible unusual significance.
