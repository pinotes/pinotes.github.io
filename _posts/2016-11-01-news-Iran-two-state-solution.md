### Iran signals its support for the two-state solution and Palestinian diplomacy

<span id="byline">October 27, 2016</span>

To preface this discussion about Iran and Palestine, this writer has never claimed to have privileged insight on Palestine. After indicating this numerous times, it is hard to make it any clearer. Maybe one can talk about polls better than a lot of others do, for example, but when you have to talk about polls conducted by Palestinians that is one clue about the extent of intimacy being claimed with the details on the ground. Nor does the writing here reflect access to the kind of intelligence even the Secretariat of State of the Roman Curia might have without having spies, apart from "open-source intelligence." Nobody here has ever claimed to be Palestinian, and in saying that, that is certainly not to say a Palestinian website couldn't arise with its own articles saying similar things.

For that matter, this writer doesn't mind anyone's not taking this writing too seriously. There are countless writers talking about Palestine in the English language, who talk ignorantly or who are part of the problem, not the solution.

Even some of those who have been in the Middle East as a political tourist or in some other capacity, but haven't been back for years, may easily say things that are wrong theoretically or analytically, not just factually -- though not because their grasp of science would be improved by being in a certain part of the world longer. And they may bring their own, special contribution to problems.

We are not claiming to have ever stepped foot in Palestine, Iran, Saudi Arabia, or any other Middle East country. However, there is a sense in which we are influenced by both Iranian and Saudi diplomacy no more or less than anyone else might be who is interested in global or Middle East politics. Those who aren't attached to a particular nation may be uniquely positioned, able and willing to say things others might not be. This partly explains why this website has both critical and friendly content about both Iran and Saudi Arabia and at times might seem to express the viewpoint of a pan-Islamic Muslim or transnational capitalist both interested in stability and struggling against Americans. The present era engenders international united fronts against the United $nakes, against which there must be major political and economic gains before conditions will favor the advancement of revolution against neocolonialism or capitalism in general. Some others, talking about supposedly proletarian revolution in Muslim or Third World countries without resolutely opposing the Amerikans, are bourgeois stooges in one way or another. Or they have made themselves useful tools of imperialist "regime change," or policies of maintaining simmering violence or weakening Third World countries, regardless of any Marxist or revolutionary rhetoric.

To the extent that it is possible to know anything of general applicability and importance about multiple countries without having set foot in any of them, this writer does claim to have such knowledge more correct than some of the things many are saying/suggesting, who are talking about Palestine. So, if the writing here seems prescient at times or seems to get things right unusually, that is the reason, not some special insight that millions of people outside Palestine couldn't have, without claiming to be leaders there. The observations made here should be easily duplicated by somebody else. In any case, the onslaught here will persist until others publish more substantive documents in English either addressing the same issues or critiquing the line of thought here.

With regard to both Iran and Saudi Arabia in the Palestinian context, there were appearances in the media of a deterioration in the Hamas-Iranian relationship in 2015 and 2016. Alternatively, if the zero-sum view of Iranian/Saudi ties with other nations is wrong as it is to some extent, it is at least the case that Hamas' ties with people in other Arab countries appeared to increase. People who are overly interested in the intentions, motivations and causes involved may pay less attention to how, regardless of cause, developments in Hamas' relationships with non-Palestinian Arabs are related to the national reconciliation struggle in Palestine that some view as necessary for advancing the two-state solution. It is conceivable that some farsighted Iranians tolerated these developments, for that reason and despite concerns about pan-Arabism while there were still Arab alliances with the U.$. hegemon, even if the perceived situation and reasons stated publicly or not were different. Fatah, not just Hamas, has a relationship with Iranians, but it may be either that Arab "influence" (if it doesn't lead to more conflict between Palestinians) can be allowed if it doesn't take away from Iranian "influence," or that Arab perceptions of a zero-sum situation with Iran may make some Iranian withdrawal from Palestinians advisable for the purpose of Palestinian unity. That may be the case even if the Iranians believe what they have said about the Iranian and Saudi pursuit of roles in the region as not being a zero-sum game. The fact that Fatah's own relationship with Saudi Arabia and some other Arab countries can be seen as less than perfect, making Iran's flexibility in some areas easier to contemplate, is another consideration.

Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia themselves took an apparent nose dive at the end of 2015. According to reports in the media, Iran and Saudi Arabia were turning their guns (figuratively, if not literally) toward each other and away from Israel well before then. Here again is a case where people should not overthink things or be distracted by rhetoric. Targeting or concentrating fire -- military, intelligence etc. -- on Israel may not always help advance the two-state solution. And constantly rejecting the two-state solution, which can be temporary as many Palestinians view it, may not advance the Palestinian cause. Maybe military operations have some inertia, and if the choice is between Israel and Saudi Arabia, both backed by the united $tates, turning the sights of the military, intelligence and diplomatic apparatuses away from Israel and toward Saudi Arabia may sometimes make sense from the point of view of any Iranian interest in the two-state solution, even just as a temporary step toward total liberation of the Palestinian nation's entire territory. At the same time, any increased cooperation or coordination with the united $tates -- which has significant contradictions with Saudi Arabia despite their alliance -- by Iran or Saudi Arabia in any area, would be worrying from the point of view of the two-state solution, which the amerikans don't really support.

<b>Iranian media refers to Palestinian diplomats again on the amerikans' hampering other countries' two-state solution initiatives</b>  

It is in this context that the reader may be interested in a recent interview of the Palestinian ambassador to the UK by official Iranian news agency IRNA.<a class="note-ref" href="#user-content-note1" name="user-content-noteref1">(1)</a> The transcript was published today. It is remarkable in a few ways. One has to do with the fact that anything that ambassador says that is public will be of interest to Britons and reflect diplomacy with the UK. The ambassador will be accountable for what ey says. Another is that the interview is an example of how Iran publicly and readily recognizes the State of Palestine and respects the Fatah-influenced PLO's choice of diplomats for the State of Palestine, which is also relevant to the PA's legitimacy despite separation of these institutions in both the abstract and the concrete. In terms of the interview's content, the ambassador said, "The peace process has been totally stalled and we are stuck between the historically inevitable and the politically impossible." That is not the same thing as saying the two-state solution is dead. "Stalled" is a word that may also be used with genuine socialist revolution in the present era.

The ambassador said there has been a stalemate since "the Camp David agreement." This apparently and curiously referred to the accords of 1978, not the failed summit of 2000. The word "Oslo" isn't in the IRNA transcript. Without naming the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian diplomat was talking with Iran about "the peace process" and its stalling. "The current stalemate is not helping because compulsive violence is becoming the name of the game again, with 50 years of occupation and 10 years of siege on Gaza." The current stalemate with "the peace process" is not helping. That is what the Palestinian was telling Iran, a supporter of organized resistance and a critic of a so-called peace process confusingly associated with the amerikans; the amerikans only want what is best for their own interests regardless of violence ten thousand kilometers away.

The ambassador's interview with IRNA shows signs of vestiges of old thinking about the two-state solution, that it must involve the united $tates "pushing" something. It would be more correct to say the united $tates must be resisted and that the world should proceed as though amerikkkans won't succeed in pressuring their government to change its Middle East policy. If it does change, most of the pressure for it will come from the outside. Ambassador Manuel Hassassian said "it is so unfortunate that the third party which is the US is not pushing for a re-engagement." However, openness toward greater Russian involvement was expressed. "We thought that the Russians influence could come back again to the scene as part and parcel of the quartet . . . ." Hassassian talked about the French initiative that involves the Arab Peace Initiative, which Iran supposedly opposes. " . . . Americans and some of the Europeans are trying to minimize and devoid the actual content of that conference which if does not work out then we lose another opportunity for re-engagement in a peace process." The ambassador goes on to say that the consequences of the amerikans' efforts, if the amerikans are successful, is that "the instability and the insecurity in the Middle East will be sustained." "The Palestinian issue" is described as being central to whether or not there will be stability in the region.

None of that is anything Palestinian diplomats hadn't talked about in public before. Also, some parts, particularly those pertaining to the amerikans' role in Middle East conflict, had appeared in Iranians' own statements. The news is that here we have a Palestinian diplomat and the Iranian government openly talking together about how the Great Satan opposes the two-state solution. The rest of the interview deals with the "long process" of trying to use the International Criminal Court against I$rael, which involves recognition of existing Palestinian statehood, Iran's support for the Palestinian nation's "request" for independence, and the Balfour Declaration, which the now-unelected international figure Mahmoud Abbas has been asking Britain to make amends for. This is not Iran rejecting diplomacy in favor of some armed or non-violent uprising/resistance as if these things were mutually exclusive.

Hassassian said "we would like to see the rectification of this position by the UK to recognize the state of Palestine rather than celebrating the establishment of a regime that has been an occupying regime in the Middle East by denying the Palestinian right to self-determination." In this way, Palestine suggested to the UK, which like almost all non-Muslim-majority countries in the world already recognizes Israel, that recognizing the State of Palestine would help to make up for Britain's role in establishing the Israeli entity in Palestine.

As for what the interview with IRNA means practically speaking, many of those claiming to reject the two-state solution -- temporary or not -- from a militant or radical perspective were relying on Iranian support whether they knew it and said so or not. Aside from the fact that the Soviet Union was no longer a socialist country by the 1967 and 1973 wars, the Soviet Union no longer exists today despite some delusionally acting like it did or that it were still the 1970s. Even a still-socialist China was saying in the 1970s that the socialist camp basically no longer existed and that it was affecting class struggle and causing it to have an international form that some may have difficulty discerning as proletarian; with the united $tates' now being the sole superpower, the situation is even worse now. What we have to deal with today are capitalist countries in various levels of accommodation with neocolonialism or ties (or conflict) with the united $nakes, with a diminished basis for a general struggle against equal imperialist countries rivaling each other. Despite sanctions and exploitation by other countries, Iran -- which is not an imperialist country -- has one of the largest economies in the world by GDP. It has been in conflict with the united $tates and has supported Palestinian liberation militarily; although, Iranian casualties in direct conflicts with Israel have not exceeded those of Arab countries that concluded peace agreements with Israel decades ago after fighting wars with it. So it is now Iran at the state level most visibly opposing the amerikan-I$raeli entity in Palestine. Yet, Iran is indicating in official media how it can get behind the two-state solution: that the united $tates opposes it. (At least, strong Iranian opposition to what Palestinian diplomats are doing in pursuit of a two-state outcome would not be viewed as friendly by those Palestinian diplomats whom they talk with so publicly.) Saudi Arabia meanwhile tries, perhaps more than some other countries do, to strike a balance between kissing amerikan ass and opposing I$rael.

Of course, the cynical will say Iran is just competing with Saudi Arabia or another Arab country to influence Palestinians. Several days ago, Iranian media published an article about a meeting with the Palestinian ambassador to Iran.<a class="note-ref" href="#user-content-note2" name="user-content-noteref2">(2)</a> Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, the international affairs advisor to the Iranian parliament speaker said "the great gap in the Islamic world regarding support for the Palestinian cause is deplorable." Amir-Abdollahian reportedly "condemned the Zionists' misguided attempts to develop relations with Arab countries as source of damage to the region and the roots of the current turmoil." This seems to refer to recent Arab overtures to Israel and Israel's own overtures and siding with certain Arab countries. The language is interesting in seeming to suggest some other approach may be in Israel's own interests. "Mr. Salah Sawawi for his part expressed gratitude for Iran's lavish support for Palestinian people; 'we see the Islamic Republic of Iran as a great country and a supporter and a patron and will never forget support of the people and the government for Palestinian issue; we also cherish the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, government, and the Parliament in not abandoning Palestinians in the Intifada as valuable and a blessing on us,' he concluded." What Amir-Abdollahian said, however, could be viewed as supporting the Arab Peace Initiative in its original form, in which normal relations with Israel are contingent on meeting and realizing certain conditions. Fulfilling that requirement is far off. Of I$raeli-Saudi relations, Ayatollah Khamenei months ago drew attention to the u.$. role.<a class="note-ref" href="#user-content-note3" name="user-content-noteref3">(3)</a> The united $tates is in control.

It is possible that Israel and Arab countries can have overlapping or intersecting interests independently of the united $tates. A shift away from the united $tates, involving Israel and Arab countries, could be welcomed by an Iran that continues to view the united $tates as the greatest enemy. It is true that Iran has strongly criticized some Arab countries in the context of alleged increased relations with Israel.<a class="note-ref" href="#user-content-note4" name="user-content-noteref4">(4)</a> Significant difficulties related to Iran have appeared in the media in relationships between Arab countries.<a class="note-ref" href="#user-content-note5" name="user-content-noteref5">(5)</a> And, a week ago, IRNA published an article that was strongly critical of some Arab states in a way that has become typical.<a class="note-ref" href="#user-content-note6" name="user-content-noteref6">(6)</a> The article supported "an independent Palestinian state in Quds" without precluding the two-state solution, though. Iranian Foreign Minister Deputy for Legal and International Affairs Abbas Araqchi said of the so-called 9/11 lawsuit law JASTA that not even the Saudi Arabia could trust the united $tates. "Speaking about Riyadh's dispute with the United States on 'Justice Against Sponsor of Terrorism Act (JASTA)', he said Washington has showed that it is not trustable." In addition, Iran this month expressed interest in building ties with Egypt<a class="note-ref" href="#user-content-note7" name="user-content-noteref7">(7)</a> and a variety of other countries<a class="note-ref" href="#user-content-note8" name="user-content-noteref8">(8)</a> that already have normal or improved relations with Israel. Many of those countries have been involved in supporting the two-state solution or have financial and economic interest in the resolution of conflicts in the Middle East that the united $tates generates, exacerbates and sustains for strategic reasons.

That should not be viewed one-sidedly either as just trying to increase Iranian influence without advancing the Palestinian cause, or as just trying to get other countries to sever ties with Israel. Convergence of economic interests in the midst of crisis is paving the way for the two-state solution. The approach of relying on a hegemonic power is not sustainable. Also unsustainable is the approach of expecting a few poor or crisis-ridden oppressed countries, that already have nonexistent or weak ties with Israel, to shoulder most of the burden of holding out for some outcome more radical than a temporary two-state stage with relative peace and sovereignty. The status quo and the amerikans who support it must be opposed without delay.

The Permanent Representative of Iran to the UN spoke last week in front of the united $tates and others at an open debate in the UN Security Council Chamber.<a class="note-ref" href="#user-content-note9" name="user-content-noteref9">(9)</a> "Under current circumstances, as always in the past, the situation in Palestine requires urgent international attention and action. The illegal and brutal Israeli occupation continues and causes so much anguish to the Palestinian people and dangerously inflames tensions in the volatile situation in the region. The Israeli regime continues to breach international law, including humanitarian and human rights law and, by doing so, inflicts widespread human suffering to the civilians and deliberately destabilizes the situation, with far–reaching and serious consequences for peace and security in the Middle East and beyond."<a class="note-ref" href="#user-content-note10" name="user-content-noteref10">(10)</a> These crimes are also the crimes of the united $nakes, which only pretends to support peace in the Middle East. &loz;
